// Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the non-duplicate element in the array.
// It is guaranteed that there is exactly one element that does not have a duplicate in the array.

// Input:
// 5,2,3,2,5
// Output:
// 3
//can we solve this problem without using map with O(n) time.
